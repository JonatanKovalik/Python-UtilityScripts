## üìú Project Overview

This repository houses a collection of practical Python scripts and small applications designed to automate various tasks, process data, and provide useful utilities. It showcases my versatility in Python programming and my ability to develop efficient, script-based solutions for everyday challenges.

## ‚ú® Projects / Scripts Included

* **ChronoEcho:** (Assuming this is a time-tracking/echoing app based on the name)
    A Python script that likely deals with time manipulation or echoing user input with timestamps.
    * [**View Project Folder**](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Python-UtilityScripts/tree/main/ChronoEcho) - *Note: You need to ensure the `ChronoEcho` folder exists at this path in your GitHub repo.*

* **Login/Signup GUI App:**
    A basic graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Tkinter, demonstrating user login and a placeholder signup functionality. This project focuses on initial GUI design, input handling, and basic window management.
    * **Features:** Login screen, signup screen, basic username/password validation (for demo purposes), and multi-window navigation.
    * **Note:** This is a demonstration of GUI principles. For real-world applications, robust security practices (like password hashing and secure data storage) would be essential.

* **Base Converter (Decimal to Binary & Binary to Decimal):**
    A command-line utility that converts numbers between base 10 (decimal) and base 2 (binary). It provides a simple interface for users to choose the desired conversion and handles basic input validation.
    * **Features:** Converts decimal to binary, converts binary to decimal, handles invalid number inputs, and allows multiple conversions in one session.

* **Simple Tkinter Window Demo:**
    A minimal Python script using Tkinter to create and center a basic GUI window. Useful for quickly setting up a graphical application's main frame.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
    * `tkinter` (for GUI applications)
    * `time` (for delays in console applications)
    * Standard Python libraries for string manipulation, input/output, and error handling.
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (or preferred Python IDE)
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Python-UtilityScripts.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Python-UtilityScripts.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the script's directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Python-UtilityScripts/
    ```
3.  **Run a specific script:**
    * **For the Login/Signup GUI App:**
        ```bash
        python your_login_app_file_name.py # Replace with the actual file name
        ```
    * **For the Base Converter:**
        ```bash
        python your_base_converter_file_name.py # Replace with the actual file name
        ```
    * **For ChronoEcho:**
        ```bash
        cd ChronoEcho
        python your_chrono_echo_file_name.py # Replace with the actual file name
        ```
    * **For Simple Tkinter Window Demo:**
        ```bash
        python your_simple_tkinter_file_name.py # Replace with the actual file name
        ```
    *(If it's a GUI application, it will open a window. For console scripts, output will be in the terminal.)*

## üß† Learning & Development

Working on these utility scripts has deepened my understanding of:

* **GUI Development with Tkinter:** Learning to create interactive windows, widgets (labels, entries, buttons), and handle user events.
* **Input Validation & Error Handling:** Implementing `try-except` blocks to gracefully manage invalid user inputs in console applications.
* **Modular Programming:** Structuring code into functions for better organization and reusability.
* **Basic Algorithm Design:** Developing logic for tasks like base conversion and user authentication flow.
* **File System Interactions:** (Potentially, if ChronoEcho or other future scripts involve file operations).

Each script presented a unique problem-solving opportunity and allowed me to apply Python's extensive standard library effectively.
