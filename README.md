## üìú Project Overview

This repository houses a collection of practical Python scripts and small applications designed to automate various tasks, process data, and provide useful utilities. It showcases my versatility in Python programming and my ability to develop efficient, script-based solutions for everyday challenges.

## ‚ú® Projects / Scripts Included

* **[Script/Project Name 1]:** [Brief description, e.g., "A number converter script supporting various bases (binary, decimal, hexadecimal)."]
* **[Script/Project Name 2]:** [Brief description, e.g., "A simple GUI application demonstrating Tkinter/PyQt usage for user interaction."]
* **[Script/Project Name 3]:** [Brief description, e.g., "A file organizer script to sort files into directories based on their type."]
* [List all other scripts/small projects here with brief descriptions.]

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python [Version, e.g., 3.9+]
* **Libraries (if any):** [e.g., Tkinter, Pandas, Requests]
* **IDE:** Visual Studio Code (or preferred Python IDE)
* **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Python-UtilityScripts.git](https://github.com/JonatanKovalik/Python-UtilityScripts.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the script's directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Python-UtilityScripts/[ScriptOrProjectName]
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python [script_name].py
    ```
    *(If it's a GUI application, it will open a window. For console scripts, output will be in the terminal.)*

## üß† Learning & Development

Working on these utility scripts has deepened my understanding of [mention specific learning, e.g., file system interactions, command-line argument parsing, basic GUI development, exception handling]. Each script presented a unique problem-solving opportunity and allowed me to apply Python's extensive standard library effectively.
